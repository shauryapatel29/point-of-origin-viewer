# point-of-origin-viewer
A visual tool capturing humanity's rapid impact on Earth's climate—how centuries of relative stability gave way to an unprecedented rise in greenhouse gas concentrations and global temperatures.

This tool uses publicly available imagery and simple web technologies to illustrate the *"The Point of Origin"* of the climate crisis, offering an accessible entry point for educators, communicators, and the climate-conscious public.
