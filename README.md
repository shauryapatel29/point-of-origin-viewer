# 🌡️ point-of-origin-viewer

A visual tool capturing humanity's rapid impact on Earth's climate—how centuries of relative stability gave way to an unprecedented rise in greenhouse gas concentrations and global temperatures.

This project combines publicly available imagery with simple web technologies to illustrate *“The Point of Origin”* of the climate crisis—offering an accessible, compelling entry point for educators, communicators, and climate-aware citizens.

## 📖 The Point of Origin

The Earth’s climate has changed over millennia due to natural cycles, but the current warming trend is different—**unprecedented in speed, scale, and cause**. Since the late 19th century, global temperatures have risen by approximately **1.1°C**, driven by surging levels of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial activity.

Atmospheric **CO₂ concentrations now exceed 427 ppm**, the highest in at least **800,000 years**. Astonishingly, most of this change has occurred in just the last **150 years**, a blink in geological time. This project visualizes that rapid shift—showing how human activity has dramatically altered Earth’s atmosphere, ecosystems, and future trajectory.
